### Hi, I'm Matt

👋🏻 Hi there. I'm a software engineer and technical leader specializing in the development of application and data platforms on the JVM.

➡️ I use **he/him/his** pronouns.

✍🏻 Sometimes I blog at https://frmr.me

🔨 I usually write Java or Kotlin. Sometimes JS, Golang, and Python. In the past I've done PHP and Ruby, as well.
