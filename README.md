### Hi, I'm Matt

👋🏻 Hi there. I'm a software engineer and technical leader specializing in the development of application and data platforms on the JVM.

➡️ I use **he/him/his** pronouns.

💼 I currently work at Greenlight Financial Technology

👨🏻‍💻 I've done a lot of work in Java 11 and am learning Kotlin. Previously I've done Scala, and Clojure on the JVM as well.

✍🏻 Sometimes I blog at https://frmr.me

🔨 I sometimes write Golang, PHP, and Python. In the past I've done JavaScript and Ruby, as well.

🤝 Most of my open source work these days happens on @lift or @dispatch, but I have some msaller projects too
